This directory contains files created for practicing git commands for class.

## Organization

The structure of this directory started with git_practice which held all
the subfiles created for practicing git. They were named wednesday.txt and
anotherfile.txt. Anotherfile.txt eventually got renamed to README.md as part
of the exercises instructions for practing git commands.

## Technologies

I am currently using a 64-bit version of windows 11.
So far I've used Git, Git-bash,Git-hub, Markdown language,
and Subversion.
